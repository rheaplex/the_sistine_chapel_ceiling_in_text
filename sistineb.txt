God's cloak (HAF), God's arm(HAE), and Adam's(HAC), stand out against it.HABThe ground.The ground cuts diagonally down across the sky (HAA) in the bottom left of the composition in blues and greens with deep shadows. On it lies Adam(HAC).HACAdam.Adam, young and voluptuously muscular with boyish features and short brown hair, reclines on the ground(HAB), leaning back on his right arm with his right leg outstretched and left leg drawn back. His genitalia are tiny and his face unsure. He turns his body towards you and his face towards God(HAE), whose hand he reaches out across the sky(HAA) to touch making an assymetry with Him. Adam's flesh is the colours of bronze, yet in light fleshy hues. His left foot is under his right leg just above the knee. The wrist of the neighbouring Ignudi (GC)almost brushes against his thigh as its arm cuts into the picture.HAEGod.God reaches out across the sky(HAA) to touch Adam's left hand(HAC) with the finger of His right hand. His left arm is around Eve's(HAH) shoulders. The finger of his left hand rests on the cherubic figure over his legs(HAJ). He turns his body towards us, right knee brought forward so his right leg crosses over his left shin. His robe is a mauve nightshirt, his hair grey and curly. His beard obscures his bronzed and aged face , although his skin elsewhere seems lighter than Adam's. God is surrounded by a troop of angels(HAI) with a red cloak(HAF) billowing around them as they sweep across the sky with Him. One figure beneath God(HAK) also stretches diagonally across in flight as if supporting Him.HAFThe cloak.The crimson cloak billows around the troop of angels(HAI) and God(HAE) as they sweep across the sky(HAA).HAHEve.Eve is a blonde renaissance woman, turning her head to watch intently from God's left arm (HAE) with her left hand. In the shadows amongst the troop of angels(HAI) her skin looks almost swarthy.HAIThe troop of angels.The blonde, shadowy figures of the troop look out from behind God(HAE) in their cloak(HAF), surrounding his torso and seemingly supporting him. One of their number seems to be holding Him up from beneath him(HAK). Another more cherubic figure(HAJ) holds onto Eve's leg(HAH) as he is swept along with the group.HAJThe cherubic figure.Muscular arms around Eve's leg(HAH), legs drawn up and turned towards us, chubby face inclined to the right yet wide eyes on us, this copper-haired figure's position above God's bare legs(HAE) seems very precarious.HAKOne of the troop.This boyish figure, curly blond hair and strong back turned to us, holds God(HAE), almost lying back on the air. Past his hair and over his left shoulder a pale viridian drapery flutters down into the air(HAA).
